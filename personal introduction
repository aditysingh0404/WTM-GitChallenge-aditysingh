Hi, I am adity singh. I am currently learning technology and want to improve my skills through real projects.
i want to join WTM because I love community learning and want guidance from experienced members.
I enjoy exploring coding, solving problems, and building useful applications.
I am still figuring out my path, but i am excited to explore more and improve step by step.
